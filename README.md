Plots are created through the notebooks in /notebooks:

* Figures 2 & 4 are produced in /notebooks/figures2_4.ipynb with additional processing from the functions in /src/fig2_4_plotting.py
This notebook also produces supplementary figures 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to similar plots that were not in the figures.

* Figure 3 is produced in /notebooks/figure3.ipynb where plots are defined in /src/fig3_plotting.py and additional processing from functions defined in /src/series_splits.py.

* The values for the extended data tables are calculated in /notebooks/extended_tables.ipynb.
